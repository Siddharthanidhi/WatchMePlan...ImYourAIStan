This is a small Streamlit app that uses Google Gemini (flash model) to autonomously infer a user’s planning request, ask only necessary clarifying questions, and produce a clear, emoji-rich step-by-step plan. 
Includes a “Download as PDF” button.

Key features:
Auto-detects planning type (trip, event, study plan, etc.)
Asks clarifying questions before generating a plan
Human-readable, emoji-enhanced plans (no raw JSON shown to users)
PDF export with clean margins and line wrapping

---

Usage:
Type a task (e.g., “Plan a 3-day trip to Kathmandu for 2 people under 25000 NPR”).
If needed, answer clarifying questions the agent asks.
View the final plan and click 📥 Download Plan as PDF.

Notes:
Uses a Gemini flash model (e.g., gemini-2.5-flash) — use the exact model your API key supports.
ReportLab is used for PDF generation (Unicode/font support). Place DejaVuSans.ttf in the project if you need emoji/unicode preserved in PDFs.
